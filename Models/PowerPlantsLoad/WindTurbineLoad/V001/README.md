# Wind turbine model

Determines the load of multiple wind turbines for the given values of hub-heights and wind velocity


## Inputs
The inputs to this model are:

1. WeatherData - Dictionary holding Power plant ids and corresponding required weather data for all power plants
1. PowerPlantsData - Dictionary holding the different required parameters of power plants

## Outputs
The output of this model is:

1. Load of all wind turbines, load values are between 0 and 1


## Properties


## Remarks
The model can be used to define and simulate the wind turbines of different sizes as follows
  1. The blade length of a wind turbine is determined for the given hub-height using equation-1 below.
  2. The wind speed at given hub-height is determined by using equation-2.
  3. The power generated by the wind turbine, with blade length determined in step-1, is determined by using equation-3.

### Implementation

The blade length of a wind turbine is determined by [1] as below
```
    r = Diameter/2     ---> eq-1
    Diameter = 10^((log10(H / a)) / b)
    where,
    H = Hub-height[m]
    r = Blade length[m]
    a = 3.413
    b = 0.6958
```
The wind speed at given hub-height is determined by
```
    Cwi,h = Cwi,ref*(ln(h/z0)/ln(href/z0))     ---> eq-2
    where,
    href = Height of the wind measurement [m]
    h = Height of interest, typically the hub-height of wind turbine
    z0 = Roughness length [m]
    Cwi,ref = Reference wind speed measured at height href [m/s]
    Cwi,h   = Wind speed at height h [m/s]
```
The power generated by the wind turbine is determined by
```
    P = 1/2 * rho * A * V^3 * Cp    ---> eq-3
    where,
    P = Power output[W]
    rho = Air density[kg/m^3]
    A = Ï€.r^2 = Swept area of blades[m^2]
    V = Wind velocity [m/s]
    Cp = Power coefficient[%]
```
The minimum wind speed generating output power is set to 4m/s, similarly the maximum wind speed is 25m/s beyond which
output will be zero is.
